# diff-cleanse
This repository contains all the code to get the results of the paper "Diff-Cleanse". We refined the baddiff, villandiff, trojdiff code, including training, sampling, and evaluation models. We've compiled elijah's code, including trigger inversion, backdoor detection, and backdoor removal.

We published the code for the diff-cleanse, including trigger inversion and prune-based backdoor removal. The pruning part of the code is developed based on diff-pruning. We appreciate baddiff/villandiff/trojdiff/diff - pruning the excellent work.

To do list:
- [] Upload the code of BadDiff (modified for more efficient measurement)
- [] Upload the code of VillanDiff (modified to run the code successfully)
- [] Upload the code of TrojDiff (add code of evaluating the model)
- [] Upload the code for trigger synthesis
- [] Upload the code for pruning

The ckpt of clean and backdoored models we used will be available with the next work (expected before September). Thank you for your attention and patience.
