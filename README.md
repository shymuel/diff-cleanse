# diff-cleanse
This repository contains all the code to get the results of the paper "Diff-Cleanse". We refined the baddiff, villandiff, trojdiff code, including training, sampling, and evaluation models. We've compiled elijah's code, including trigger inversion, backdoor detection, and backdoor removal.
We published the code for the diff-cleanse, including trigger inversion and prune-based backdoor removal. The pruning part of the code is developed based on diff-pruning. We appreciate baddiff/villandiff/trojdiff/diff - pruning the excellent work.
